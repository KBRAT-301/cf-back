- Our application will enable a user to input data based on their habits and lifestyle. The input will then calculate the user's carbon footprint.

- The pain point that this would be solving is helping and educating users to realize the impact they have on the earth every day. Just the education alone will help spread the word and make for more thought out decisions among the community.

- Our MVP is to have a working app that can calculate at least an average yearly footprint for a user based on transportation data input.

- Stretch goals will include input for food consumption and home utility use.
